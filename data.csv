","Bonalu is one of the most popular and widely celebrated festivals in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Celebrated in the month of Ashadam, the month-long festivities take place to thank Goddess Mahakali as women across the state dress in traditional attire and offer Bonam to the goddess. A bonam or meal consists of cooked rice with jaggery, curd and water which is placed inside an earthen pot. Each of these pots is decorated with flowers and carried by women on their heads to offer to the deity.

The origins of the festival date back to the 19th century when a battalion of Hyderabad Military prayed to the goddess to eradicate the plague that had devastated the city. If the goddess did so, the battalion would install an idol of Mahakali in Hyderabad. It is believed that the goddess did eradicate it and the battalion installed the idol. The festival holds great significance and hence In 2014, when the state of Telangana was formed, Bonalu was declared the State Festival.

The festivities start from the Golconda Fort as women carrying bonalu walk and reach the temple.
